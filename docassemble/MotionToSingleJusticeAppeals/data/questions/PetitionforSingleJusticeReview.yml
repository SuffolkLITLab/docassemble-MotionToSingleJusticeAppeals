  Petition for Single Justice Review
subquestion: |
  Use this form if you would like a single justice of the Appeals 
  Court to review a decision made by the trial court judge that
  is not a final judgment of the court. The law that allows for 
  this is [G.L. c. 231, s. 118, paragraph 1](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleII/Chapter231/Section118).
  
  **You can only seek review of an order of the trial court within 30 days
  of the trial court judge's decision.**
  
  This form will be sent to a single justice of the appeals
  court for review.
